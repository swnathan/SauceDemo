# Test Automation Engineer - Coding Challenge

Welcome! We're super happy to have you here and that you are interested in working with the Capmo Engineering Team. To get a better idea of your automation skills, we'd like you to complete the following coding challenge. Some rules & guidelines.

- You can pick whatever programming language you like
- Make sure the app runs in a UNIX like environment, such as Linux or Mac OS.
- The submited application doesn't require for-pay software
- The submitted app contains instructions on how to run it
- Strong bonus: the submitted app is containerised

## Description

Write tests to automate the [saucedemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com/) e-commerce website, design and implement crucial test-cases for it, as well as the underlying test automation framework. Complete the assignment as you would do for a production scenario.

### Automation requirements

## Bonus

When running your test-cases, use the `performance_glitch_user`.

## What we are looking for

- software engineering craftmanship
- an eye for software architecture, especially for the famework and the underlying configuration
- robust automation that can deal with underlying changes of the software
- correctness of the submitted code
- proper separation of concerns
- simple solutions
